## Introduction
This project was completed in collaboration with a team from the University of Toronto for the course STA258H5 S - Statistics with Applied Probability.

Mental health issues among youth are a global concern. This investigative study delves into the relationships between various life satisfaction aspects and perceived mental health among Canadian youth. The intention behind this analysis is to understand whether areas of life satisfaction (like housing, body image, etc.) impact the mental well-being of these individuals.

## Methodology
The main dataset used for the analysis was the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2017-2018. Our study focused on analyzing the relationships between different aspects of life satisfaction and their perceived mental health. Specifically, we looked into:

- Satisfaction with housing
- Satisfaction with friends
- Satisfaction with oneself
- Satisfaction with body image
- Satisfaction with financial situation

These variables were analyzed in relation to perceived mental health, and the influence of demographic factors like gender and household income on these relationships was also considered.

## Discussion and Results
Visualizations such as clustered bar charts and contingency tables were utilized to investigate associations. Key findings include:

1. An individual's perception of their mental well-being is associated with their satisfaction levels pertaining to housing, body image, financial circumstances, interpersonal relationships, and self-worth.

2. In regards to various household incomes, we observed a notable trend: As stated income increased, the correlation between satisfaction (be it housing or financial status) and perceived mental health became increasingly pronounced.

3. Segmenting our data by gender revealed interesting findings. Both females and males exhibited a visible correlation between positive mental health and their contentment with body image, self-assessment, and relational bonds. Intriguingly, this correlation was more robust among the male sample across these satisfaction dimensions.

## Limitations
While our analysis provides some interesting insights, it's crucial to remember that the CCHS dataset, like many surveys, has limitations. For instance:

1. The data is self-reported, which can introduce bias.
2. Not all potential confounding factors may have been considered in our analysis.
3. Sample representation might not capture the entire spectrum of youth experiences in Canada.

## Conclusion
The analysis suggests that different aspects of life satisfaction indeed influence perceived mental health among Canadian youth. Understanding these associations can help policymakers and educators devise better strategies to support youth mental health. However, further research and larger sample sizes might be required to draw more concrete conclusions.
